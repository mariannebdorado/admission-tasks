# Scenario A
Jane is an applicant who completed all the necessary steps in the application process (it took her more than 10 hours to build the Flix app). She was marked as ineligible because she lives in Thailand and is not currently enrolled in the US. When she received this, she was very disappointed and responded back saying that we were not clear about the eligibility requirements and that she feels like she wasted 10 hours building her pre-work app. She still wants to attend the course even if she is not enrolled in a US university. She strongly suggests for you to make an exception because she is very interested to learn and she visits the US very frequently anyway. 

All of our applications have at least two sections for eligibility checks on the front page. However, we usually notice that applicants just tick those off without reading. (But we also don’t want to accuse them of doing this.)

CodePath currently runs classes in Haiti. We also used to run classes in Taiwan. We might be expanding to other countries in the future but not as of yet. Based on the current sponsorships we receive as a non-profit organization, our courses are restricted to students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States. 

On the other hand, we also know that completing the application process is very tedious and don’t want her to feel that we don’t care about the efforts she’s placed into her application. How do you let her down gently?

# Response:
Hi Jane,

A pleasant day to you! We appreciate the time and effort you put into this application but we are very sorry to mark you as ineligible for the courses we offer here at CodePath. 

As you can see in our set of prerequisites and eligibility published on our website: https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/syllabus#heading-prerequisites-and-eligibility, student applicants should be enrolled in a University or College here in the US. Based on the current sponsorships we receive as a non-profit organization, our courses are restricted to students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States.  


CodePath currently runs classes in other countries other than the US. We have classes in Haiti and also used to run classes in Taiwan. We are looking into expanding to other countries in the future, but not as of yet because of the current situation.

A class in Thailand is possible in the future, and we would like to invite you to send your application again once it happened.

We look forward for your application in the future, and we wish you all the best in your studies and endeavors.

Sincerely,
Marianne
