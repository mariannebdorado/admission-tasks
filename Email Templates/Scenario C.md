# Scenario C
Dennis is from San Jose State University and completed all their requirements for their Tech Fellow application about 3 weeks ago. This is the first time they have heard about the program so they are naturally very excited about getting started. Since they haven’t heard back for more than 2 weeks, they are worried that something is wrong with their application. 

Before we can admit tech fellows into the tech fellow training, there has to be at least one more eligible Tech Fellow from the same school who completed their requirements as well. This means that until there are at least two of them who completed the admissions requirements, we won’t be able to admit them and they stay in the pipeline. This waiting process sometimes takes close to a month. What can you tell them to keep them engaged until then?

Hi Dennis,

A pleasant day to you! We received your Tech Fellow application and appreciate the commitment you put into this application.

We have a different process in handling Tech Fellow application. Before we can admit Tech Fellows into the Tech Fellow training, there has to be at least one more eligible Tech Fellow from the same school who completed their requirements as well. This means that until there are at least two of them who completed the admissions requirements, we won’t be able to admit them and they stay in the pipeline. These requirements can be found on our website: https://info.codepath.org/fall21techfellows.

This whole waiting process sometimes takes close to a month. We value your time and commitment, and we know how hard it is to wait especially when it has been three weeks since you sent your application, but are we asking for your patience and wait for our next call regarding your application.

Again, thank you and we look forward to welcome you soon to our Tech Fellow Training.

Sincerely,
Marianne
