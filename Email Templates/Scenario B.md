# Scenario B: Applicant who missed the deadline
Anne is interested in our Summer Interview Prep course but missed the deadline, which was two weeks ago. The class is full and we already have a long waitlist. Normally, we would invite applicants to apply again next year since we run this course every summer. However, Anne graduates this Spring and will be ineligible to take our course next year. She also says that she has been applying internship programs for over 100 companies but has not been able to get an offer.

These scenarios usually break our heart, especially because we try to make our courses available to as many people as possible. When applicants in similar scenarios approach us, we usually share our [high-level software interview guide](https://https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view) containing tips and guidelines that applicants might find helpful. It might also be helpful to redirect them to our resources page to learn more and invite them to sign up for our mailing list in case there are future courses or virtual events that she might be interested in. How do you do this while expressing empathy?
