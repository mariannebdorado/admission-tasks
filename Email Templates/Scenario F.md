# Scenario F: Guru didn’t give the grade for the interview
Marie is already done with her interview schedule but her grade is not reflected in the tracker. We also haven’t received any email from the guru who conducted the interview. After the interview, gurus usually update the tracker and provide the Tech Fellow grade and verdict.

Our gurus are technical teaching assistants who are experts in their field. They are responsible for overseeing the overall health of the course per cohort throughout the semester. How will you ask the assigned guru for Marie’s grade?

Hi Guru,

Hope you're having a great day! As part of processing our Tech Fellows applications, I would like to inquire about one of our applicants interview grade.

She is Marie, and already done with her interview schedule, but her grade is not yet reflected in the tracker. We also haven't received any update email from you regarding her grade.

We understand how busy are, but we also appreciate you taking time to look into it and provide us Marie's grade so we can proceed with the application process and come up with the Final Verdict.

Thank you and I look forward to your response.

Kind regards,
Marianne
