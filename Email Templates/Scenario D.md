# Scenario D: Applicant doesn’t know what the next steps are
Jake received an email from us saying that he hasn’t completed his application for the Android University course. He doesn’t know what else he has to do and where to submit it. He also wants to know what the schedule of the class is.

We ask Android applicants to complete a pre-work project. The details of how and where to submit can be found there. In most cases though, we want to be very clear about the next steps. Can you spell out the remaining steps for him to complete his application? Make sure you also provide the schedule for his class.

Hi Jake,

A pleasant day to you! Thank you for submitting you application for the On Campus Admission. 

As part of our process, you need to complete the [Pre-work](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/android_university/prework) upon submission of application. The pre-work assignment is meant to give you a preview of our course and help you set-up your environment prior to the start of class. It will also help us determine your ability to complete the assignments during our course.

Applicants will need to complete the questionnaire and pre-work in order to be considered for admission.

AS for the schedule of classes, please refer to the schedule below:
- **Live session attendance:** Classes meet once or twice per week for 1-2 hour sessions over the duration of the semester.
**NOTE:** Session frequency and duration may vary depending on college.
- **Outside of class time:** Students should plan to spend 5-10 hours outside of class working on weekly assignments and their final group project.

Kindly complete the prework so we can start accessing and processing your application. Thank you!

Sincerely,
Marianne
