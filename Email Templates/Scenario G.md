# Scenario G: Ineligible TF (not CS-related major)
Jose is an applicant whose major is not CS-related. Despite seeing the sections for eligibility checks on the front page, he still managed to send us an application. 

Currently, CodePath runs classes for students who major in CS-related courses. We are not yet accepting non-CS students. How do you let him down gently?

# Response

Hi Jose,

A pleasant day to you! Thank you for the time and effort you put into your application. While we appreciate your commitment in being one of our students, we regret to inform you that we cannot process your application since your major is not related to Computer Science.

As you can see in our [List of Prerequisites and Eligibility](https://https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/syllabus), one of our requirements for application is the course of the applicant should be related to Computer Science or Software. Currently, we are not accepting non-CS students.

Again, we would like to thank you for your time and we wish you all the best in your future endeavors.

Sincerely,
Marianne
