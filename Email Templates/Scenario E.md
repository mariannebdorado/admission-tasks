# Scenario E: Tech Fellow is following up their status - rejection already sent but was not received
Maria is from Bryn Mawr College and has completed all their requirements for their Tech Fellow application. Unfortunately, we had to reject her due to failed interview. We already sent her the rejection email 2 weeks ago but Maria seems to have not received it so she sent us a follow-up.

Tech Fellows go through an interview with our gurus before they are admitted into the Tech Fellow training. There are very few times when we reject Tech Fellows due to different reasons and one of them is a failed grade from their interview. How will you tell her that an email was already sent 2 weeks ago and at the same time inform her of the status of her application without sounding negative?

Hi Maria,

A pleasant day to you! Confirming receipt of your follow up email regarding your application status. We have sent you a status email two weeks ago, but we appreciate that you reached out to us to follow up and know the status of your application.

While we appreciate the time and commitment you put into this application, we regret to inform you that at this time, we cannot process your application as you didnâ€™t received a passing rate for your interview with our Tech Fellow Gurus.

You may reapply next year and we are hoping to see you as our next Tech Fellow student. Again, thank you.

Sincerely,
Marianne
